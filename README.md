# SPH_Simulation

If you want to compile project you have to have QT VS Tools installed in your Visual Studio.
You can find already compiled file in folder "Compiled".

This application uses code from here:
http://bigtheta.io/2017/07/08/implementing-sph-in-2d.html

I just put it into Qt and added functionality.
